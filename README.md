## What's this?

This is the source for my personal homepage/business card website at http://nathos.com/

It uses [Amicus](https://github.com/nathos/amicus), my project template for the [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) static site generator.

Amicus features [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) grid system, and lots of best practices.

## It's Responsive!

The project features a flexbiel responsive grid based on the [Susy "Magic" grid system](http://susy.oddbird.net/demos/magic/). Try resizing your browser or viewing the page on various mobile devices.

## How do I use it?

Start by installing [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/), if you don't already have it:

Then do a ```bundle install``` to install the required gems -- even Middleman itself!

Use ```middleman``` to do your live development and ```middleman build``` to render your static file output to the ```/build/``` directory.

For full Middleman documentation, visit the [Middleman website](http://middlemanapp.com/).
